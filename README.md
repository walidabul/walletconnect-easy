# walletconnect-easy
Simple example for beginners for wallet-connect 1

now there is version 2. Its a good idea to start with version 1 and move to version 2.

Althhough wallet connect is super simple and easy to use.
Still for every beginners in Web3 it is always a bit intimmidating to understand the idea and get the first hello world working. Web3 space is evolving very fast, this makes tutorial and examples on the internet differ from each other and there is no end-to-end example that works in a single try. Specially vanilla javascript examples are very limited.


Feel free to use this code and reference and build your amazing DApps.............

define provider

initialize web3 object

get account information from web3 object

get balance from web3 object

down the line smart contract deployment and interations are all possible using this web3 object.
